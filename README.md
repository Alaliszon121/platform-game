I never thought I would make my game available here, and yet I did. I'm making it available here due to the fact that I've uploaded my profile on GitHub as a portfolio for the Girls in the Game program, and once recruitment is over, I plan to remove this repository, as it's a project I'd like to work on and develop in addition to using it for larger purposes in the future.
