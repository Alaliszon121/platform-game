# Jerry the Traveller!
I never thought I would make my game available here, and yet I did. I'm making it available here due to the fact that I've uploaded my profile on GitHub as a portfolio for the "Dziewczyny w Grze" program, and once recruitment is over, I plan to remove this repository, as it's a project I'd like to work on and develop in addition to using it for larger purposes in the future.

## General info <3
**General info**: 2D, pixel art, platformer, Godot engine, GDScript language.

**Plot Outline**: The game begins when the main character Jerry, a book lover, finds an old book in the library that he has never seen before and, interested, reaches for it. The book is about time travel and, fascinated, he sits up late reading it the last time a portal appears to draw him in! The hero loses consciousness and wakes up in a dense jungle, next to him having a mysterious book. It turns out that he has landed in the place that the first part of the book told about - the Age of Dinosaurs. He quickly comes to the conclusion that in order to return home he must experience a journey through all the eras described in the book. Along the way he encounters many adversaries, but also friendly creatures who help him on his journey through time. However, will he manage to reach home?
